PassPair:
A website that matches skiers / snowboarders based on what passes they have and their availability. It will allow for users to meet new people on the slopes through API integration by connecting overlapping details. Furthermore, it will direct users to websites where they can actually purchase ski passes, however it will not actually handle credentials or money for security purposes. The primary purpose of this application is to connect people with similar resort passes at similar times and to help those who may not have any pass or those who are new to winter sports to connect to others.
A secondary purpose that we are considering is giving reviews to individual resorts that update in real time, for example there may be someone who wants to let everyone know that a certain resort is busy right now. We are even considering adding features to let you comment or review individual runs over different periods of time so someone may be able to see reviews made that day, that week, or that year to find recent information to see what an individual run is like that day or see more reviews over time to see how good it is in general. All of these features are subject to change and are not entirely indicative of what may appear in the final project because, as stated above, the primary purpose is to connect those with similar passes and have individual profiles, everything else is a bonus.
